# AI-Object-Detection
AI Object Detection Project Description
Objective:
Develop an AI system that can automatically identify and locate multiple objects within an image.

Project Overview:
Object detection is a computer vision technique that not only classifies objects in an image but also determines their positions using bounding boxes. This project uses pre-trained deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or MobileNet SSD to detect common objects such as people, cars, animals, and everyday items in images or video streams.

Key Features:

Input can be an image or a live video stream (e.g., from a webcam).
The model processes the input to detect multiple objects.
For each detected object, the system draws a bounding box and labels it with the object class and confidence score.
Utilizes transfer learning to adapt pre-trained models for efficient detection without requiring massive datasets or extensive training.
Technologies Used:

Python programming language
Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch
Pre-trained models such as YOLOv3/v4, SSD, or MobileNet
OpenCV for image and video processing
Potential Applications:

Surveillance and security systems
Autonomous vehicles
Retail inventory management
Robotics and automation
